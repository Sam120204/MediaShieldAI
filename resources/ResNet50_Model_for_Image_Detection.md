### Detailed Explanation of ResNet50

**Overview:**
ResNet50 is a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) with 50 layers. It addresses the problem of training very deep networks by introducing residual blocks, which use shortcut connections to jump over some layers. This helps to prevent the vanishing gradient problem, enabling the training of much deeper networks.

**Architecture Breakdown:**
1. **Initial Layers:**
   - Convolution layer with a 7x7 filter and 64 output channels.
   - Batch normalization and ReLU activation.
   - Max pooling layer with a 3x3 filter and stride of 2.

2. **Residual Blocks:**
   ResNet50 includes several stages of residual blocks:
   - **Conv1_x:** One convolutional block (Conv Block) with 64 filters, followed by two identity blocks with 64 filters.
   - **Conv2_x:** One convolutional block with 128 filters, followed by three identity blocks with 128 filters.
   - **Conv3_x:** One convolutional block with 256 filters, followed by five identity blocks with 256 filters.
   - **Conv4_x:** One convolutional block with 512 filters, followed by two identity blocks with 512 filters.

3. **Final Layers:**
   - Average pooling layer.
   - Fully connected layer with 1000 units (for ImageNet classification).
   - Softmax activation for classification.

**Residual Block:**
A residual block consists of:
- **Convolutional layers:** Multiple convolutional layers with batch normalization and ReLU activation.
- **Shortcut (skip) connection:** Adds the input of the block to the output of the convolutional layers, ensuring the gradient can flow through the network without diminishing.

**Convolutional Block vs. Identity Block:**
- **Convolutional Block:** Used when the input and output dimensions differ. It includes a convolutional layer in the shortcut path to match dimensions.
- **Identity Block:** Used when the input and output dimensions are the same. The shortcut path is a simple identity mapping.

### Implementation of ResNet50 in Keras

Here's a simplified implementation of ResNet50 using the Keras library:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, BatchNormalization, Activation, Add, Input, GlobalAveragePooling2D, Dense
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model

def identity_block(input_tensor, filters):
    f1, f2 = filters

    x = Conv2D(f1, (1, 1))(input_tensor)
    x = BatchNormalization()(x)
    x = Activation('relu')(x)

    x = Conv2D(f1, (3, 3), padding='same')(x)
    x = BatchNormalization()(x)
    x = Activation('relu')(x)

    x = Conv2D(f2, (1, 1))(x)
    x = BatchNormalization()(x)

    x = Add()([x, input_tensor])
    x = Activation('relu')(x)
    return x

def conv_block(input_tensor, filters, strides=(2, 2)):
    f1, f2 = filters

    x = Conv2D(f1, (1, 1), strides=strides)(input_tensor)
    x = BatchNormalization()(x)
    x = Activation('relu')(x)

    x = Conv2D(f1, (3, 3), padding='same')(x)
    x = BatchNormalization()(x)
    x = Activation('relu')(x)

    x = Conv2D(f2, (1, 1))(x)
    x = BatchNormalization()(x)

    shortcut = Conv2D(f2, (1, 1), strides=strides)(input_tensor)
    shortcut = BatchNormalization()(shortcut)

    x = Add()([x, shortcut])
    x = Activation('relu')(x)
    return x

def ResNet50(input_shape=(224, 224, 3), classes=1000):
    inputs = Input(shape=input_shape)

    x = Conv2D(64, (7, 7), strides=(2, 2))(inputs)
    x = BatchNormalization()(x)
    x = Activation('relu')(x)
    x = tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((3, 3), strides=(2, 2))(x)

    x = conv_block(x, filters=[64, 256], strides=(1, 1))
    x = identity_block(x, filters=[64, 256])
    x = identity_block(x, filters=[64, 256])

    x = conv_block(x, filters=[128, 512], strides=(2, 2))
    x = identity_block(x, filters=[128, 512])
    x = identity_block(x, filters=[128, 512])
    x = identity_block(x, filters=[128, 512])

    x = conv_block(x, filters=[256, 1024], strides=(2, 2))
    x = identity_block(x, filters=[256, 1024])
    x = identity_block(x, filters=[256, 1024])
    x = identity_block(x, filters=[256, 1024])
    x = identity_block(x, filters=[256, 1024])
    x = identity_block(x, filters=[256, 1024])

    x = conv_block(x, filters=[512, 2048], strides=(2, 2))
    x = identity_block(x, filters=[512, 2048])
    x = identity_block(x, filters=[512, 2048])

    x = GlobalAveragePooling2D()(x)
    x = Dense(classes, activation='softmax')(x)

    model = Model(inputs, x)
    return model

# Instantiate the model
model = ResNet50(input_shape=(224, 224, 3), classes=1000)
model.summary()
```

**Explanation of the Code:**
1. **Identity Block:**
   - Takes an input tensor and a list of filter sizes.
   - Performs a series of convolutions with ReLU activations.
   - Adds the input tensor to the output of the convolutions.

2. **Convolutional Block:**
   - Similar to the identity block but includes a convolution operation in the shortcut path to match the dimensions of the input and output tensors.

3. **ResNet50 Function:**
   - Defines the overall architecture of ResNet50.
   - Combines initial layers, convolutional blocks, and identity blocks to form the complete network.
   - Ends with a global average pooling layer and a dense layer for classification.

4. **Model Summary:**
   - Prints the summary of the ResNet50 model, showing the layers and their output shapes.

This implementation captures the essence of ResNet50, providing a powerful model for image classification and other tasks. By using pre-trained weights and fine-tuning, this architecture can be adapted for various computer vision applications.
